# globalHumanSettlement
Generate the global 30-m human settlement dataset (GHS30) from 1985 to 2020.

JS code for delineating and classifying years of global human settlement patches in Google Earth Engine.

GHS30 is the first global fine human settlement extents derived from the global 30 m impervious-surface (ISA) dynamic dataset and the global residential population of GHS-POP. detection. It utilizes a refined classification system containing 4 human settlement types and covers the time span from 1985 to 2020 with an update cycle of 5-year. In specific, the global human settlement patches were delineated from the ISA data using a developed model that consisted of kernel density estimation, initial boundaries delineation, and morphological processing. The classification schema oriented to the typologies of human settlement patches was defined by combining the size of population and the population density within each patch that was calculated from GHS-POP.

Fig. Spatiotemporal patterns of the expansion of global urban-rural settlement during 1985-2020. The global distribution patterns of the four settlement types in 1985 and 2020 (a-b). Both global maps are at 0.05Â° resolution for a better illustration. Inset pies in a, b represents the global proportions of different settlement types in the corresponding year. The total areas of global urban/rural settlements (c-d) in the corresponding year. The expansion areas of human settlement and their typological characteristics in the top 20 countries and all continents during 1985-2020 (e-f).
